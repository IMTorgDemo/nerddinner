        <p>Are you a huge nerd? Perhaps a geek? No? Maybe a dork, dweeb or wonk. Quite possibly you're just a normal person. Either way, you're a social being. You need to get out for a bite to eat occasionally, preferably with folks that are like you.</p>
        <p>Enter @Html.ActionLink("NerdDinner.com", "Index", "Home"), for all your event planning needs. We're focused on one thing. Organizing the world's nerds and helping them eat in packs.</p>
        <p>We're free and fun. Find a dinner near you, or host a dinner. Be social.</p>
        <p>We also have blog badges and widgets that you can install on your blog or website so your readers can get involved in the Nerd Dinner movement. Well, it's not really a movement. Mostly just geeks in a food court, but still.</p>
